# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature aims to enhance the test coverage for the Lambda Canary Workshop CDK stack by adding comprehensive unit tests, integration tests, and validation tests. The current test suite covers basic infrastructure components but lacks thorough testing of edge cases, error conditions, configuration variations, and integration scenarios. Enhanced testing will improve code quality, catch regressions early, and provide confidence in deployments across different environments.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive unit tests for all stack components, so that I can catch configuration errors and regressions early in the development cycle.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the stack is instantiated with different environment contexts THEN the system SHALL validate all configuration parameters are correctly applied
2. WHEN invalid configuration is provided THEN the system SHALL fail gracefully with clear error messages
3. WHEN the Lambda function configuration changes THEN the system SHALL verify all dependent resources are updated accordingly
4. WHEN different deployment configurations are used THEN the system SHALL validate the canary deployment settings are correct

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want integration tests that verify component interactions, so that I can ensure the entire system works together correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the API Gateway is deployed THEN the system SHALL verify it correctly integrates with the Lambda alias
2. WHEN the CloudWatch alarm is triggered THEN the system SHALL verify it properly monitors the Lambda function errors
3. WHEN the CodeDeploy deployment group is created THEN the system SHALL verify it references the correct alarm and deployment configuration
4. WHEN multiple environment contexts are used THEN the system SHALL verify cross-environment configuration consistency

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want validation tests for security and compliance, so that I can ensure the infrastructure meets security standards.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN IAM roles are created THEN the system SHALL verify they follow the principle of least privilege
2. WHEN Lambda permissions are granted THEN the system SHALL verify they are scoped appropriately
3. WHEN API Gateway is configured THEN the system SHALL verify security settings are properly applied
4. WHEN resources are tagged THEN the system SHALL verify all required tags are present and correctly formatted

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want performance and resource validation tests, so that I can ensure the infrastructure is optimized and cost-effective.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Lambda function configuration is set THEN the system SHALL verify memory and timeout settings are appropriate
2. WHEN CloudWatch alarms are configured THEN the system SHALL verify thresholds and evaluation periods are reasonable
3. WHEN API Gateway stages are created THEN the system SHALL verify caching and throttling settings are configured
4. WHEN deployment configurations are applied THEN the system SHALL verify canary deployment percentages and timing are optimal

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want error handling and edge case tests, so that I can ensure the system behaves correctly under various failure scenarios.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN stack deployment fails THEN the system SHALL verify rollback mechanisms work correctly
2. WHEN invalid Lambda code is provided THEN the system SHALL handle the error gracefully
3. WHEN API Gateway limits are exceeded THEN the system SHALL verify appropriate error responses
4. WHEN CloudWatch alarm states change THEN the system SHALL verify deployment automation responds correctly

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want parameterized tests for different environments, so that I can validate the stack works correctly across development, staging, and production configurations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN different environment types are specified THEN the system SHALL apply environment-specific configurations correctly
2. WHEN region-specific settings are used THEN the system SHALL validate regional resource configurations
3. WHEN account-specific parameters are provided THEN the system SHALL verify cross-account resource references
4. WHEN environment-specific tags are applied THEN the system SHALL verify tag propagation to all resources
